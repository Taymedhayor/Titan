# Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

## Objectives
Predict  if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.

### Dependencies
## -Numpy
## -Pandas
## -mattplotlib
## -Seaborn
## -Sklearn

### Purpose of this Notebook
The purpose of this notebook is to provide an insight and a quick solution to the Titanic Machine Larning from Disaster.The analysis and modelling was done with python. The notebook is to help anyone get started with the competition and get familiar with python and machine learning modules.

## Modelling and Predicting 
Six different classifier was trained to predict the outcome of the passenger under SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING and the best model for the prediction was ranked 	

## Note:
The Model is yet to be deployed.
